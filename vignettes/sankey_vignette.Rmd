library(Assignment2)
Introduction
The Assignment2 package provides a function, plot_sankey_diagram(), for creating Excel‑style Sankey diagrams using ggplot2.
This vignette demonstrates how to recreate the provided Excel Sankey chart visualizing stroke risk factors over time.

Key features of the function:
- Vertical gaps to separate stacked ribbons
- Horizontal gaps to leave white space between connectors and rectangles
- Minimum ribbon size for better visibility of very small proportions

Basic Usage
- The package includes an example dataset, stroke_data, which matches the structure of the Excel file.

# Load the example dataset included in the package
```r
data("stroke_data")
```

# Basic Sankey diagram with no gaps
```r
plot_sankey_diagram(stroke_data)
```

# Adding Vertical and Horizontal Gaps
You can toggle gaps by setting vertical_gap or horizontal_gap to TRUE.
# Diagram with both vertical and horizontal gaps
```r
plot_sankey_diagram(stroke_data, vertical_gap = TRUE, horizontal_gap = TRUE)
```
Adjusting Minimum Ribbon Size
For very small proportions, set a minimum ribbon size so that labels are easier to read.
```r
plot_sankey_diagram(stroke_data, min_ribbon_size = 0.06)
```

Conclusion
This vignette demonstrates how the plot_sankey_diagram() function replicates the Excel Sankey chart style in R.
You can customize:
- Colors (by editing the function’s color scale)
- White space (with vertical_gap and horizontal_gap)
- Ribbon visibility (with min_ribbon_size)

For further styling, you can apply additional ggplot2 themes or save your plots with ggsave().
